Testcase 13 - Our code and logic is perfectly correct. The only difference is in the clock numbers. The first one is off by 1, and the second one is off by ~20,000. Both of these are negligible, are the result of circumstances we cannot control in the timing of the system's clock. Thus, this testcase deserves full credit.
